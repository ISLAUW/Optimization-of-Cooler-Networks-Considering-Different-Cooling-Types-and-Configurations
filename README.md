# Optimization-of-Cooler-Networks-Considering-Different-Cooling-Types-and-Configurations

On the basis of theories on process optimization and mathematical modeling method, a series of superstructure based optimization model on cooler and pump networks are provided in this work, which is also my master's thesis.

The publications are as follows:

[Sequential optimization of cooler and pump networks with different types of cooling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544219309090)

[Optimization of cooler networks with different cooling types in series and parallel configuration](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b04059)
